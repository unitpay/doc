# Unit.Reciepts

**Unit.Reciepts** is an alternative to Unitpay's online cash register. Our solution makes the job of sending cheques as easy as possible for you: you put it entirely in our hands. We send reciepts to your customers and to the OFD, from where the data is passed on to the tax office. No need to keep track of overflow fiscal drive, separately register a cash register in a private office of the tax office or rent a cash register - the whole process of connection takes a few clicks.
