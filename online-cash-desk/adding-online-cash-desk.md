# Adding online cash desk

According to requirement 54-FZ, it is necessary to send receipts to the buyer and the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.

To generate checks at the same time as making payments, you need to connect an online cashier.

You can:

* buy cash desk by yourself and integrate it through unitpay
* connect a ready-made solution - Unit.Receipts

**How to add:**

1. Log in
2. Go to Management-&gt;online cash registers
3. Choose an option
4. If your choice is different from Unit.Receipts then populate required fields
5. Click 'Connect' button

In order to generate a receipt it is necessary to send several parameters when creating a payment.

If the online cash desk has been activated, and the required parameters have not been transferred, the payment solution won't work \(payments will be made with the error\)
