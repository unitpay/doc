* Using ready modules for popular cms/saas-systems 
* Using [the SDK ](https://help.unitpay.ru/v/master/modules/unitpay-sdk)
* By [API ](https://help.unitpay.ru/v/master/payments/create-payment)
* You can also [generate a payment link](https://help.unitpay.ru/v/master/payments/payment-links) in your personal Unitpay account in the "Goods" section of your project \(to enable this function, contact support or your personal manager\). 

Don't forget to specify "Payment Processor" and the link to which the user will need to be redirected in case of a successful payment.

Note that acceptance of funds is open by default for certain countries.

### Countries

If you need to connect additional countries to accept payments in the project, first it must pass the final moderation. After that the "Countries" tab will appear in your project settings:

screen

You need to choose which countries you want to connect to receive payments, attach supporting documents and send your application.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Application for connection of additional countries can be sent once a month, so it is recommended to attach the documents confirming the traffic to the application at once. This significantly increases the probability of their connection.
{% endhint %}

You will receive a notification after submitting your application:

If you sent the correct supporting documents, the application will be approved and the status in the "Countries" tab will change:

If the required traffic confirmations were not attached to the application, the application is likely to be rejected and the status in the "Countries" tab will change:
