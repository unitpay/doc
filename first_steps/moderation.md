# Project Moderation

**Initial moderation of the project**

If the initial moderation is successful, payment acceptance will be available within 10 minutes after the project is added to the system. Such a project will be temporarily assigned to the Start category.

Initially, your project is assigned to the **Start category**. This means that your project has passed the **initial verification**. After full verification of the project by the security department of Unitpay, other payment methods may be activated for you, payment acceptance fees may be reduced, and payouts from your account may become available.

Full project verification is performed within 72 hours after successful identification of the account owner. Approval of some websites belonging to certain categories may take longer time.

**Identification of an individual when registering without a legal entity**

The ability to withdraw funds, lower fees and access to all payment acceptance methods are provided to the identified partners only. These partners are users who have registered with a personal WebMoney certificate. To become an identified user without a WebMoney certificate, you need to pass the identification procedure. Those users who have more than one thousand \(1,000.00\) rubles on their account balance have the right to send identification documents on [My payouts](https://unitpay.money/partner/payout) page,

**In short**: withdrawal of funds from accounts without a legal entity or a personal WebMoney certificate is available to partners who have successfully passed the identification procedure.

**Final moderation of the project**

A full website check includes checking the operability of the site, as well as the content of the main sections of the site. A detailed description of the company and its products or services, relevant contact information and a working support service will help you pass moderation faster and avoid unnecessary questions from the security department. See the list of requirements below.
