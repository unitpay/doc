# Google Pay

\[ _We are working on the ability to use **Google Pay** now. Estimated release date - December 2020_ \]. 

**Google Pay** is a fast and simple payment method that allows you to make card payments without entering card details for each payment. The card data is safely stored by **Google**. This payment method is available for all devices \(mobile phones and computers\), regardless of the operating system and web browser.
